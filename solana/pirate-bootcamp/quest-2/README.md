## This quest involves writing a small Unity-based program on the Solana blockchain

I am skipping this quest and moving on to the next one, as this one doesn't fit my needs. But anyone interested can check the resources.md file.  

I am including a link to the folder below containing the quest-2 from the original bootcamp repository.
